# Debugging Procedure

## When to Apply

Activate when: an error occurs, a test fails, or behavior doesn't match expectations.

## 6-Step Protocol

### Step 1: Reproduce

- Run the failing command or test
- Capture the exact error message and stack trace
- Note the environment (OS, Node version, VS Code version)

### Step 2: Isolate

- Find the smallest input or scenario that triggers the failure
- Comment out code to narrow the scope
- Use `git stash` to test against clean state if recent changes may be the cause

### Step 3: Read the Error

Stack trace reading pattern:
- **Top frame**: Where the error manifested (symptom)
- **Middle frames**: Call chain (context)
- **Bottom frames**: Entry point (trigger)
- Ignore `node_modules` frames unless the bug is in a dependency

### Step 4: Generate 3+ Competing Hypotheses

Generate **at least 3 competing hypotheses** before investigating any one. This prevents anchoring bias (fixating on the first plausible explanation).

For each hypothesis, document:

| Field | Content |
|-------|--------|
| **Theory** | What you think is wrong |
| **Supporting Evidence** | What makes this plausible |
| **Contradicting Evidence** | What argues against it |
| **Verification Plan** | Exact steps to prove/disprove |
| **Fix Approach** | What you'd change if confirmed |

Investigate from most likely to least likely. After each verification:
- **CONFIRMED**: Apply fix, skip remaining hypotheses
- **DENIED**: Cross off, move to next
- **PARTIAL**: Combine with other hypotheses

If all hypotheses fail: re-examine your assumptions, widen scope (check recent deploys, environment changes, dependency updates), form 3 new hypotheses.

For complex bugs, maintain a `HYPOTHESIS.md` in the working directory to track investigation state across sessions.

### Step 5: Fix ONE Thing

- Make the minimal change that fixes the issue
- Run the failing test — it should now pass
- Run the full test suite — nothing else should break

### Step 6: Verify and Document

- Confirm the fix in the original scenario
- Add a regression test if one didn't exist
- Write a clear commit message: what was wrong, why, and what fixed it

## VS Code Agent Debugging

- Use `#debugEventsSnapshot` in chat to attach a snapshot of loaded customizations, token consumption, and agent behavior as context.
- Use `Developer: Open Agent Debug Panel` for real-time skill loading, instruction matching, and hook execution visibility.
- These tools complement brain-qa by showing runtime loading state vs. disk state.

## Agent Tooling Pitfall

- Avoid large parallel file-creation bursts when generating many text-heavy artifacts in VS Code.
- More than 4 simultaneous file writes can trigger temporary UI freezes through explorer refresh, file watchers, and preview/render churn.
- Prefer smaller batches or sequential writes when creating multiple SVG/Markdown/code files in one folder.
