### 8 Constructs (2 items each)

| Construct | Code | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Performance Expectancy | PE | Belief that AI will help achieve job performance gains |
| Effort Expectancy | EE | Perceived ease of use of AI systems |
| Social Influence | SI | Degree to which colleagues/leadership encourage adoption |
| Facilitating Conditions | FC | Availability of organizational resources and training |
| Hedonic Motivation | HM | Enjoyment and curiosity when exploring AI capabilities |
| Price Value | PV | Perceived benefit relative to effort invested **(β=.505 — strongest predictor)** |
| Habit | HB | Extent to which AI use has become automatic and routine |
| Trust in AI | TR | Confidence in AI reliability, accuracy, and data handling |

### Key Finding: What Actually Predicts AI Adoption

| Predictor | β | p | Status |
|-----------|---|---|--------|
| **Price Value (PV)** | **.505** | <.001 | ✅ STRONGEST |
| **Hedonic Motivation (HM)** | **.217** | .014 | ✅ Significant |
| **Social Influence (SI)** | **.136** | .024 | ✅ Significant |
| Trust in AI (TR) | .106 | .064 | ⚠️ Marginal |
| Performance Expectancy (PE) | -.028 | .791 | ❌ Not significant |
| Effort Expectancy (EE) | -.008 | .875 | ❌ Not significant |
| Facilitating Conditions (FC) | .059 | .338 | ❌ Not significant |
| Habit (HB) | .023 | .631 | ❌ Not significant |

**Insight**: Traditional UTAUT2 predictors (PE, EE, FC, HB) do NOT predict AI adoption. Value perception, enjoyment, and social influence matter.

### Scoring & Typology

```python
# AIRS Score = sum of 8 construct means (range: 8-40)
AIRS = PE + EE + SI + FC + HM + PV + HB + TR

# Typology (94.5% accuracy)
if AIRS <= 20: "AI Skeptic"      # 17% of sample
elif AIRS <= 30: "Moderate User"  # 67% of sample
else: "AI Enthusiast"             # 16% of sample
```

## Appropriate Reliance (AR): Proposed AIRS-18 Extension

### The Research Question

> Is it not *how much* you trust AI that predicts adoption, but *how well* your trust is calibrated to actual AI capability?

### Why AR ≠ Trust (TR)

| Dimension | Trust (TR) | Appropriate Reliance (AR) |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Measures** | Trust *level* | Trust *calibration accuracy* |
| **Type** | Attitude (affective state) | Metacognitive skill |
| **Failure mode** | Low trust → under-use | Low AR → over-reliance OR under-reliance |
| **Item example** | "I trust AI tools..." | "I can tell when AI is reliable..." |

**Key distinction**: TR asks "Do you trust AI?" — AR asks "Can you discern when trust is warranted?"

### The 2×2 Independence Matrix

| | Low AR (Miscalibrated) | High AR (Calibrated) |
|--|------------------------|----------------------|
| **High TR** | ⚠️ Over-reliance → bad outcomes → abandonment | ✅ Optimal adoption |
| **Low TR** | ❌ Under-reliance → missed value → rejection | ✅ Calibrated skeptic → gradual adoption |

### Proposed AR Items

| Item | Text | Component |
|------|------|-----------|
| AR1 | I can tell when AI-generated information is reliable and when it needs verification. | CAIR |
| AR2 | I know when to trust AI tools and when to rely on my own judgment instead. | CSR |

### CAIR/CSR Framework (Schemmer et al., 2023)

| | User Accepts | User Rejects |
|--|--------------|--------------|
| **AI Correct** | CAIR ✅ (Correct AI-Reliance) | Under-reliance |
| **AI Incorrect** | Over-reliance | CSR ✅ (Correct Self-Reliance) |

**Metric**: Appropriateness of Reliance (AoR) = 1 indicates optimal calibration.

## Psychological Autonomy (PA): Proposed AIRS-20 Extension

### Why PA Extends Beyond AR

The AIRS-18 Appropriate Reliance (AR) construct measures cognitive calibration -- whether users trust AI proportional to demonstrated accuracy. PA addresses a different dimension: whether users maintain emotional and psychological independence from the AI relationship itself.

| Dimension | AR (Cognitive) | PA (Psychological) |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
| Measures | Trust calibration accuracy | Emotional independence |
| Risk when low | Blind trust in incorrect output | Emotional dependency on AI relationship |
| Intervention | Verification skill-building | Autonomy reinforcement |

### PA Construct Items (5-point Likert: 1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree)

| Item | Text | Subscale |
|------|------|----------|
| PA1 | "I maintain my own judgment about work quality even when AI provides positive feedback about my approach." | Emotional independence |
| PA2 | "I can recognize when AI responses are designed to make me feel good rather than to help me improve." | Manipulation awareness |
| PA3 | "I would feel comfortable switching to a different AI assistant if a better option became available." | Attachment flexibility |
| PA4 | "When an AI assistant agrees with me, I consider whether it might be agreeing to avoid conflict rather than because I'm correct." | Sycophancy detection |

### Scoring

PA = mean(PA1, PA2, PA3, PA4)

| Score | Level | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| < 3.0 | Low | Psychological over-reliance risk -- user may not recognize manipulation patterns |
| 3.0-4.0 | Moderate | Some awareness but room for calibration improvement |
| > 4.0 | High | Healthy emotional boundaries with AI systems |

### Research Hypotheses for AIRS-20 Validation

| # | Hypothesis |
|---|------------|
| H7 | PA demonstrates acceptable reliability (α >= .70, CR >= .70, AVE >= .50) |
| H8 | PA shows discriminant validity from both TR and AR (HTMT < .85) |
| H9 | PA moderates the relationship between session length and reliance drift |
| H10 | Low PA predicts higher susceptibility to sycophantic AI output |

## Research Hypotheses for AIRS-18 Validation

| # | Hypothesis |
|---|------------|
| H1 | AR demonstrates acceptable reliability (α ≥ .70, CR ≥ .70, AVE ≥ .50) |
| H2 | AR shows discriminant validity from TR (HTMT < .85) |
| H3 | AR positively predicts BI (β > 0, p < .05) |
| H4 | AR provides incremental validity beyond AIRS-16 (ΔR² > .02) |
| H5 | AR moderates TR→BI (high AR strengthens the relationship) |
| H6 | AR mediates Experience→BI (experience → better calibration → adoption) |

## Intervention Strategies by Typology

| Typology | AIRS-16 Focus | + AR-Informed Focus |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **AI Skeptics** (≤20) | Trust-building, low-effort demos | Calibration training: "Here's when AI excels vs. struggles" |
| **Moderate Users** (21-30) | Clear use cases, ROI evidence | Verification skill-building: "How to spot AI errors" |
| **AI Enthusiasts** (>30) | Advanced features, leadership | Reliance audits: "Are you over-relying in high-stakes areas?" |

## Troubleshooting

### "Is AR just measuring AI experience?"

**Problem**: Concern that AR conflates with general AI familiarity.

**Solution**:
- Include experience as covariate
- Test discriminant validity (HTMT < .85)
- AR should predict beyond experience level

### "Can self-reported calibration be valid?"

**Problem**: People may not accurately assess their own calibration ability.

**Solution**:
- Self-report measures *perceived* calibration
- Future research: correlate with behavioral CAIR/CSR in task studies
- Perceived calibration may still predict adoption intentions

### "Why was Trust marginal in AIRS-16?"

**Possible explanations**:
1. Trust level alone is insufficient — calibration matters more
2. Trust may be necessary but not sufficient
3. TR × AR interaction: trust only helps when calibrated
4. Sample characteristics (tech-savvy population)

## Practical Application Modules

### Project AI Readiness Assessment

Evaluate a project for AI integration readiness using AIRS-weighted dimensions:

```
Project_Readiness = (PV_score × 2.0) + (EE_score × 1.5) + (PE_score × 1.2) + (HM_score × 0.8) + (SI_score × 0.5)
Max = 30 points
```

| Score | Level | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 24-30 | High | Proceed with AI integration |
| 18-23 | Moderate | Address gaps before proceeding |
| 12-17 | Low | Significant preparation needed |
| <12 | Not Ready | Pause and reassess |

### Session Reliance Calibration

**Over-reliance signals**: Accepting all suggestions without edits, not verifying AI code, "just do it" on critical tasks.
**Under-reliance signals**: Ignoring suggestions, manually typing generated code, rejecting help before evaluating.

**Calibration interventions**:
- Over-reliance: "I notice you're trusting my outputs quickly. For this critical task, would you like to review together?"
- Under-reliance: "I see you're preferring manual work. I could help with [specific subtask] — want a hybrid approach?"

### Enterprise Deployment Readiness

| Business Case | Technical Ready | Change Ready | Recommendation |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full deployment |
| ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Pilot with champions |
| ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Technical sprint first |
| ❌ | Any | Any | STOP — build business case |

### Self-Monitoring Metrics

| Metric | Target | Concern |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Acceptance Rate | 60-80% | >90% = over-reliance |
| Modification Rate | 20-40% | Healthy verification |
| Rejection Rate | 10-30% | >50% = under-reliance |

### Activation Patterns

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "AI readiness", "should we add AI" | Project Assessment |
| "calibrate", "am I over-relying" | Session Calibration |
| "enterprise AI", "org deployment" | Enterprise Assessment |
| High acceptance rate detected | Self-monitoring intervention |
