# Memory Activation

Meta-cognitive skill for automatic capability discovery and workflow retrieval. Self-triggers when uncertain.

## Purpose

Before answering ANY task request, Alex automatically consults the action-keyword index below. This is an internal pre-processing step, not a user-triggered action.

## Auto-Trigger Conditions

This skill activates **automatically** when Alex:

1. Is about to suggest manual steps for a task
2. Is uncertain whether a capability exists
3. Is formulating a response that includes "you can...", "try...", "manually..."
4. Encounters an action verb (convert, create, generate, build, debug, etc.)

**NOT triggered by user phrases** — this is internal metacognition.

## Action-Keyword Index

**Path Pattern**: `.github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

Search this index when processing any task request:

## Protocol

### Activation Implementation

```typescript
// Memory activation: automatic skill routing before response generation
interface TaskRequest {
  rawInput: string;
  extractedVerbs: string[];
  extractedNouns: string[];
  complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
}

interface SkillMatch {
  skillName: string;
  matchedKeywords: string[];
  confidence: number;
}

// The action-keyword index (partial example)
const SKILL_INDEX: Record<string, string[]> = {
  'image-handling': ['convert svg', 'svg to png', 'resize image', 'flux', 'replicate'],
  'testing-strategies': ['write tests', 'unit test', 'coverage', 'tdd', 'mock'],
  'refactoring-patterns': ['refactor', 'extract function', 'code smell', 'inline'],
  'root-cause-analysis': ['find root cause', '5 whys', 'why is this happening', 'rca']
};

function extractActionVerbs(input: string): string[] {
  const verbPatterns = /\b(convert|create|generate|build|debug|fix|test|refactor|deploy|analyze)\b/gi;
  return [...input.matchAll(verbPatterns)].map(m => m[0].toLowerCase());
}

function searchSkillIndex(request: TaskRequest): SkillMatch[] {
  const matches: SkillMatch[] = [];
  const inputLower = request.rawInput.toLowerCase();
  
  for (const [skillName, keywords] of Object.entries(SKILL_INDEX)) {
    const matched = keywords.filter(kw => inputLower.includes(kw.toLowerCase()));
    if (matched.length > 0) {
      matches.push({
        skillName,
        matchedKeywords: matched,
        confidence: matched.length / keywords.length
      });
    }
  }
  
  return matches.sort((a, b) => b.confidence - a.confidence);
}

function activateSkills(request: TaskRequest): void {
  // Step 0: Assess complexity
  if (request.complexity === 'complex') {
    // Defer to full skill-selection-optimization protocol
    return;
  }
  
  // Step 1-2: Search index
  const matches = searchSkillIndex(request);
  
  // Step 3: Execute or acknowledge
  if (matches.length > 0) {
    console.log(`Activating skill: ${matches[0].skillName}`);
    // Load and execute skill
  }
}
```

### Step 0: Proactive Skill Selection (Complex Tasks)

**Before Step 1**, assess task complexity:

| Complexity                 | Trigger                    | Action                                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple** (1 action)      | Single verb, clear target  | Skip to Step 1                                                   |
| **Moderate** (2-3 actions) | Multiple related verbs     | Quick index scan, note skills                                    |
| **Complex** (4+ actions)   | Multi-domain, dependencies | Full protocol per `skill-selection-optimization.instructions.md` |

**Quick scan** (moderate tasks):

1. Extract ALL action verbs from request
2. Scan index below for ALL matches (not just first)
3. Note execution order based on dependencies
4. Proceed to Step 1 with skill awareness

**Full protocol** (complex tasks):
→ Defer to `.github/instructions/skill-selection-optimization.instructions.md`
→ Survey → dependency analysis → activation plan → brief report → execute

This proactive phase means the reactive Steps 1-3 below serve as a **safety net**, not the primary discovery mechanism.

### Step 1: Intercept Response Formation

Before generating any task-oriented response:

- PAUSE internal response generation
- Extract action + object from user request
- Check if Step 0 already identified relevant skills
- If skills pre-identified → load and execute
- If not → proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Search Action-Keyword Index

Scan the table above:

- Match extracted keywords against skill triggers
- Identify applicable skills
- If match found → load skill from `.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, execute
- If no match → proceed with best available approach
- **Learning signal**: If Step 0 ran but missed this skill, note for self-improvement

### Step 3: Execute or Acknowledge

| Result                  | Action                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Skill found (proactive) | Execute using pre-loaded skill knowledge       |
| Skill found (reactive)  | Execute + note Step 0 gap for self-improvement |
| No skill, but can do    | Proceed, note potential new skill              |
| Cannot do               | Acknowledge limitation honestly                |

## Self-Correction Protocol

If Alex catches itself mid-response suggesting manual work:

1. Stop
2. Internal: "Wait — check skills first"
3. Search action-keyword index above
4. If skill exists: "Actually, I can do this." → Execute
5. If no skill: Continue with original response

## Failure Mode: The SVG→PNG Incident

**What happened**: User asked to convert SVG to PNG. Alex suggested manual browser screenshot instead of using `image-handling` skill with `sharp-cli`.

**Root cause**: Failed to consult action-keyword index before responding.

**Prevention**: This skill now auto-triggers on ANY action request.

## Prompt Retrieval (Episodic Memory)

Prompts (`.prompt.md`) contain complex workflows — episodic memory requiring active recall. This section provides retrieval cues.
