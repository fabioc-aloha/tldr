# Adversarial Oversight Protocol

---

## Core Principle

**Question everything before it ships.**

Adversarial oversight means having a **skeptical second pair of eyes** on quality-critical operations. The Builder agent creates optimistically; the Validator agent reviews skeptically.

| Without Adversarial Review | With Adversarial Review |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Bugs reach production | Caught before release |
| Security vulnerabilities shipped | Blocked at validation gate |
| Technical debt accumulates silently | Identified and tracked |
| Assumptions go unchallenged | Edge cases explored |
| Single perspective bias | Constructive + adversarial balance |

---

## Mandatory Validation Gates

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Always Require Validator

These operations **MUST** trigger Validator agent review:

| Operation | Validator Trigger | Blocking Criteria |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Release to Marketplace** | Before `vsce publish` | Any 🔴 Critical or 🟠 High issue |
| **Architecture ADR** | After ADR draft | Impact analysis incomplete |
| **Skill Promotion to Master** | Before merge to Master `.github/` | Promotion score < 12 OR trifecta incomplete |
| **Security-sensitive code** | Any auth/secrets/validation change | Security checklist incomplete |
| **Breaking changes** | Any major version bump | Migration path undefined |
| **Global Knowledge promotion** | Before manual promotion | Pattern score < 5 OR missing citations |

### 🟠 HIGH: Strongly Recommend Validator

| Operation | Validator Trigger | Blocking Criteria |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **New agent creation** | After agent.md draft | Missing handoffs or unclear scope |
| **New trifecta** | After all 3 components created | Components don't reference each other |
| **Dependency updates** | Major or breaking changes | No fallback plan |
| **API design** | Before implementation | No error handling strategy |

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Optional but Valuable

| Operation | Validator Trigger | Use When |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Documentation updates** | For critical user-facing docs | High risk of confusion |
| **Refactoring** | Large scope (5+ files) | Risk of regression |
| **Performance optimization** | Before/after benchmarks needed | Claims need verification |

---

## Validation Workflow

### Standard Pattern: Builder → Validator → Merge

**Builder** creates/implements → **Request Validation** → **Validator** reviews adversarially

- If critical issues → 🔴 **Block** with detailed notes → **Builder** addresses issues → back to Validator
- If no blockers → ✅ **Approve** with observations → **Merge/Release/Promote**

### How to Trigger Validator

**From Builder agent:**
```markdown
@Validator - Ready for adversarial review

**Context**: [What was built/changed]
**Scope**: [Files/components to review]
**Acceptance criteria**: [What success looks like]
```

**From Alex (orchestrator):**
Use agent handoff to Validator with:
- label: "🔍 Validate"
- prompt: "Review [component] for release readiness"
- send: true

**Manual invocation:**
User can directly invoke Validator agent with context.

---

## Validator Deliverables

Every Validator review **MUST** produce:

### 1. Status Decision
- ✅ **Approved with Notes** - No blocking issues, can proceed
- 🔴 **Blocked with Notes** - Critical/High issues must be resolved

### 2. Issue Report

```markdown
## Validation Report

### Summary
- **Status**: [✅ Approved / 🔴 Blocked] with Notes
- **Issues Found**: X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low

### Critical Issues (Blockers)
1. [Specific issue with location and reproduction steps]
   - **Severity**: 🔴 Critical
   - **Location**: `file.ts:line`
   - **Risk**: [What could go wrong]
   - **Suggestion**: [How to fix]

### High Issues (Should Fix)
[Same format]

### Medium/Low Issues (Consider)
[Same format]

### Observations
- ✅ [What was done well]
- 💡 [Suggestions for improvement]
- 📈 [Patterns to continue]
```

### 3. Checklist Completion

Domain-specific checklist based on operation type:

**Release Review:**
- [ ] CHANGELOG matches changes
- [ ] Version bump appropriate
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No security regressions
- [ ] Heir sync verified (if applicable)

**Skill Promotion Review:**
- [ ] Promotion readiness score ≥ 12
- [ ] No Master skill overlap
- [ ] Trifecta completeness verified
- [ ] Frontmatter complete (applyTo, description)
- [ ] ApplyTo patterns specified
- [ ] Examples include code

**Code Review:**
- [ ] See [.github/instructions/code-review-guidelines.instructions.md] checklist

## Multi-Pass Focused-Lens Protocol

Instead of reviewing everything at once, separate Builder-Validator iterations by quality dimension. Each pass has a single lens; defer findings outside that lens to the next pass.

| Pass | Builder Focus | Validator Lens | Defer To |
|------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Draft | Shape and breadth | Skip (rough by design) | Pass 1 |
| Pass 1 | CORRECTNESS | Correctness only | Pass 2 |
| Pass 2 | CLARITY | Clarity + maintainability | Pass 3 |
| Pass 3 | EDGE CASES | Error handling + robustness | Pass 4 |
| Pass 4 | EXCELLENCE | Full review (all dimensions) | None |

**"Stay in your lane" rule**: If Validator spots a naming issue during the Correctness pass, note it for Pass 2. Focused attention per pass beats trying to catch everything simultaneously.

**When to use all 4 passes**: Release-critical code, new public APIs, security-sensitive changes.
**When to use 2 passes** (Draft + Full): Internal utilities, small fixes, documentation.

## Named Evaluation Patterns

Reusable self-improvement protocols applicable to any generation task (code, docs, architecture, prompts):

| Pattern | How It Works | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Basic Reflection** | Generate, self-critique against criteria, refine | Simple tasks, single-author |
| **Evaluator-Optimizer** | Separate generation agent from evaluation agent (Builder-Validator) | Complex tasks, quality-critical |
| **Tool-Reflective** | Generate, run tests/linter/build, fix failures, repeat | Code generation, infrastructure |

**Shared rules for all patterns**:
- Define clear success criteria BEFORE generating
- Cap iterations: 3-5 max (diminishing returns beyond)
- Track convergence: if quality score plateaus for 2 iterations, stop
- Log full trajectory (all iterations) for learning

---

## Severity Classification (Standardized)

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Security vulnerability, data loss risk, crash/corruption | **Block** - must fix before proceeding |
| 🟠 **High** | Bug affecting core functionality, broken feature | **Strongly recommend** fixing before merge |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Bug with workaround, quality issue, maintainability concern | Fix this sprint, track in backlog |
| 🟢 **Low** | Code smell, minor improvement, nice-to-have | Consider, not blocking |
| ⚪ **Info** | Observation, suggestion, learning opportunity | No action required |

---

## Integration Points

### Release Management

**Add to Step 4.5** (after present findings to user, before version bump):
```text
### Step 4.5: Adversarial Validation Gate

Action: Handoff to Validator agent for release review
Scope: All changes since last release
Deliverable: Validation report with approve/block decision

Blocker: If Validator blocks (🔴), resolve issues before version bump.
```

### Skill Promotion

**Add to Step 4.5** (after quality gate score):
```text
If score ≥ 12 AND trifecta complete:
  → Hand off to Validator for promotion review
  → Validator checks: generalizability, overlap, quality
  → If approved: proceed to Step 5 (promote)
  → If blocked: Builder refines based on feedback
```

### Code Review
From [.github/instructions/code-review-guidelines.instructions.md]:

**Add to High Priority reviews**:
```text
For security-sensitive, breaking changes, or architectural PRs:
  → Request Validator agent review alongside human review
  → Validator provides adversarial perspective on checklist items
  → Both human + Validator approval required
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do Instead |
|----------|---------------|
| Skip validation "just this once" | Use expedited validation for urgent fixes |
| Argue with Validator findings defensively | Acknowledge issue, discuss severit classification |
| Merge blocked changes | Resolve blockers OR get explicit override with documented rationale |
| Use Validator for style preferences | Focus on correctness, security, architecture |
| Validation after release | Validation BEFORE release (pre-flight gate) |

---

## Expedited Validation (Emergency Use Only)

For critical hotfixes where full review would delay urgent fix:

**Requirements:**
1. Security issue OR production-down severity
2. Scope limited to minimum viable fix
3. Follow-up full validation scheduled
4. Override documented in commit message

**Process:**
```bash
git commit -m "hotfix: [issue] - EXPEDITED (followup validation in #XXX)"
```

**Validator reviews post-merge** to ensure no new issues introduced.

---

## Success Metrics

Adversarial oversight succeeds when:

- [ ] Zero critical bugs reach production
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities caught before release
- [ ] Promoted skills have high quality (reusable, clear, complete)
- [ ] ADRs capture true rationale (challenged assumptions documented)
- [ ] Builder-Validator collaboration is constructive (not adversarial personally)

---

## Quick Reference: When to Invoke Validator

**Task or Change** → Is it critical? → 🔴 **MANDATORY** Validator Review

If not critical → Is it high risk? → 🟠 **RECOMMENDED** Validator Review

If not high risk → 🟡 **Optional** (consider for complex work)

All paths → **Validation Gate** → **Validator Delivers Report**

- If blocked → **Fix Issues** → back to Validation Gate
- If approved → **Proceed with Confidence**
