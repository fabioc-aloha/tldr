# Security Review

Comprehensive security review covering dependencies, secrets, configuration, and code.

## What I Check

### 1. Dependency Security

```bash
npm audit        # Node.js
pip-audit        # Python
cargo audit      # Rust
dotnet list package --vulnerable  # .NET
```

- Known CVEs in dependencies
- Outdated packages with security fixes
- Suspicious or typo-squatted packages

### 2. Secret Detection

Scan for accidentally committed secrets:

- API keys, tokens
- Passwords, connection strings
- Private keys, certificates
- `.env` files in git

### 3. Configuration Security

- Are defaults secure?
- Is HTTPS enforced?
- Are CORS settings appropriate?
- Are error messages sanitized?

### 4. Code Patterns

- Input validation present?
- Output encoding/escaping?
- SQL parameterization?
- Authentication/authorization checks?
- Logging sensitive data?

## OWASP Top 10 Quick Check

| # | Risk | Quick Check |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | Broken Access Control | Auth checks on all endpoints? |
| 2 | Cryptographic Failures | Secrets in code? Weak crypto? |
| 3 | Injection | User input sanitized? |
| 4 | Insecure Design | Threat model exists? |
| 5 | Security Misconfiguration | Debug mode in prod? |
| 6 | Vulnerable Components | npm audit clean? |
| 7 | Auth Failures | Session management solid? |
| 8 | Data Integrity Failures | Updates signed? |
| 9 | Logging Failures | Security events logged? |
| 10 | SSRF | URL validation? |
